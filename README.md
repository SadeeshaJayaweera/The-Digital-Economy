EVALUATION
EVALUATION OF THE TRANSACTIONAL WEBSITE
I have used ebay.co.uk transactional website for my investigation because it is
one of the most popular e-commerce websites in the world.
My thought about this site is that it is easy to use, which manages the customer
from the sign in to the end of purchase by providing guidance. This web site has
everything that a customer would imagine from an e-commerce site with
extraordinary security methods.
This site has a very user-friendly interface. Because vital frames remain constant
throughout the website. Due to the unchanged theme and font protects the
professional look of the website. This site has a well-designed layout and it
consists of the drop-down menu of “shop by category” which expand with many
subcategories, therefore user able to choose subcategories without scrolling up
and down.
Thus the user is able to search their products in relevant category with ease of use
All the details are provided to the customer, once the customer selects a product
customer can have details like price, colours, reviews, etc. A preview picture also
displayed along with those details, so the customer can have a good look of the
product by zooming it in and off. This way customer can has a good identity about
the product before the purchase.
The payment procedure is very simple in ebay.co.uk, however, if it becomes hard
to the user so the user can go further with the website guidance because
ebay.co.uk provide well-designed guidance to their customers.
If the user received a defective item, he/she can have a replacement or refund by
providing evidence to the seller, however, if hard to deal with the seller user can
open a case; once this is done ebay.co.uk will review the case and offer a good
solution to the customer.
MY OPINION ABOUT THE WEBSITE
I think ebay.co.uk can improve their website by adding new colourful images and
animations furthermore.
However, there are some fake sellers too in this website, who sells product and
take money from the user without providing the product to the user. Many
existing users can identify fraud sellers but new users may cannot. If ebay.co.uk
can resolve this issue, then they can attract many people.
In any case, ebay.co.uk has every single feature which is important to every ecommerce website. In this case; ebay.co.uk has limits and ability to challenge
equivalent websites.
EVALUATION OF THE DATABASE
The database I designed for the CD orders consisted of three tables and they are
customer, order and product table. These mentioned tables have one to many
relationships in between. As I had only 3 tables, the product will only save at
once. Along these lines, as an improvement, another two tables should be
created to store customers credit card details separately since the present
structure doesn't allow customers to use more than one credit card.
The database was carried out using Microsoft Access 2016. I executed vital
validations for the 3 tables. I did a few tests for the three tables. I imported data
from a text file to a temporary table and appended into three tables by append
queries.
EVALUATION OF MY OWN PERFORMANCE
For unit 2 (The knowledge worker), I was supposed to prepare a report on an
ecommerce website. For my investigation, I choose ebay.co.uk The main reason I
chose this software is because I have ordered many products from this website
and I have good knowledge regarding this website.
The entire structure of the website and the functions are fully explained and
illustrated by providing various screenshots in the ecommerce file. All the
captured screenshots have annotations which make easy for reader to
understand.
After completing the investigation about ebay.co.uk, I have described what
happens when a user proceeds to the checkout. Flow diagrams are used to
explain the process and each process were listed on there.
Thereafter I made a research using the internet and noted down the threats to
the data and listed the measure that are taken by the ecommerce website. Also I
have added all the terms and conditions of the website by taking screenshots of
the ecommerce website.
Once it was completed. I designed a database for a CD dealer. That I mentioned
above consisted of three tables, recommendation and queries with comments on
how can a business improve and make more profit.
In general, I am satisfied with how I have done my report on Unit 2. Also, I was
able to complete the entire unit 2 coursework within the allocated time limit
given to me. However, I'm satisfied with how I've finished my report on Unit 2.
